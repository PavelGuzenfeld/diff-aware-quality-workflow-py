# naming-exceptions.txt — Additional file/directory naming exception patterns
# One regex per line. Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
# These patterns are matched against each path segment (directory or filename without extension).
#
# Examples:
# ^vendor$              # vendor directory
# ^third_party$         # third-party directory
# ^generated$           # generated code directory
# ^Gems$                # O3DE Gem directories
# ^Code$                # O3DE Code directories
