# CodeQL CI template.
# Copy into .github/workflows/ and adjust build commands.
#
# Provides deep inter-procedural taint tracking and data flow analysis.
# Free for public repositories. Private repos require GitHub Advanced Security license.

# C++ coverage: 200+ CWEs (buffer overflow, use-after-free, format string, injection, etc.)
# Python coverage: 160+ CWEs (SQL injection, XSS, command injection, SSRF, etc.)
#
# Results appear in the GitHub Security tab and as PR annotations.
